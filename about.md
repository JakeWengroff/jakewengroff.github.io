This blog was created to track my transition from PR professional to software engineer.  

'Flack' is slang for a publicist.  A hacker is a programmer.  I figured the best name for this blog would be Flacker.

It's a coding blog, but here and there you may read my random musings about media, marketing, and publishing.
