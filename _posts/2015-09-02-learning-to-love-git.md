summary:    It was invisible and kept throwing me errors, so why do so many developers swear by it?

No coding bootcamp promotes Git as one of the languages or frameworks that they teach.  No one I've met at a MeetUp boasts specialized knowledge of or expertise in Git. In the Indeed.com search bar, typing 'Git' does not have an auto-complete, like the way 'Ruby' does for 'Ruby on Rails'.

So why do I have to learn it to become a Web developer?

Though I've had to install Git for online tutorials and courses and learn basic functionality, I quickly realized why:  Git is the fundamental language for dynamically publishing public code to GitHub, as well as sharing your work in a team environment.

It's for workflow, process, and becoming a developer with a real job, project, or client. Git is one of the important tools and resources that a programmer needs -- but no one will tell you that you must master the fundamentals or else you'll be left out.

I got it.

But I didn't get it, because it kept throwing me errors, and I often couldn't continue with a project because I had to resolve the Git issue first.  Argh.

My Bloc mentor Brittany Martin suggested a great Git resource, FirstAidGit.

The Git website actually has *the entire ProGit book* available for free, for download.  Here is the link.

But of course, as with all error messages, what does any true programmer do?  Why Google the error message!

This error used to freak the @#$%&! out of me:

<h3>Learning by Breaking Things</h3>
Funny story, I didn't really break anything other than my patience or ego, but some of you may have had this same experience when you first learned to code:  A few times, I would push a repo to GitHub, then change the branch on the command line.  I would go back to the text editor -- I was using Sublime Text at the time (btw, please someone out there, tell me I am NOT the only junior developer who paid $70 for the full license to Sublime!) -- and exclaim, Holy @#$%&!, What happened to my other version?  It was like in the olden days of Microsoft Word when your new version wasn't saved.  I would then freak out, break a sweat, and then -- yes, you guessed it -- re-enter all of the changes to make it look like the version I thought I lost, and then save.

About 2 months went by when I was inadvertently switching between branches and noticed lightning-fast changes in Sublime. And then I had one of those developer a-ha! moments and realized, 'Now I understand what Git does!'

But I think one of the reasons why Git was so confusing and opaque was because I had no idea where all of these 'branches' or 'previous versions' were stored. In my hard drive, apparently. Switching to the Atom editor makes this a lot clearer, as sitting right there, first on the list, is the .git folder.  

<h3>Git Commit Messages</h3>
This I think is really cool, and useful.  Maybe it's the tech journo/PR person in me, but this part really is a feature which I think should move beyond the engineering team and out into the business units -- but it probably won't ever happen.

This is the ability to leave detailed messages with your Commits. This way, literally, everyone is on the same page.
