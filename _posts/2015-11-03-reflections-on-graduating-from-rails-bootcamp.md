Yesterday, I graduated from the [Rails Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp) bootcamp offered by Bloc.

It was the quietest graduation ever. I received a congratulatory email from Bloc, and my parents' response was simply, 'Oh, great!'

But I'm not complaining at all. I wasn't expecting some sort of celebration -- that stuff doesn't matter to me.  None of the gifts I received upon graduating from high school, college, or business school really mattered in the long run (or short run for that matter).  What matters is what you receive in knowledge -- that is the gift.

But this blogpost will not be some grandstanding musing on education-as-its-own-reward.

Instead, I'm here to share the observation that graduation from a coding bootcamp is nothing when compared to the learning that must continue, and I can only hope that others who have graduated from bootcamps feel the same.

On the one hand, I feel like saying, 'That's it?' but on the other hand, I'm like, 'Yeesh, look at what I have to do now!'

To be fair, I try to comfort myself by saying, 'I can't believe where I was earlier this year compared to where I am now.'

In fact, I didn't take a break at all:  before my November 2 graduation date, I jumpstarted my dormant subscription to [Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com) and completed both Python Basics and JavaScript Basics.  

I'm performing Google searches on 'beginner JavaScript projects' so I can build something to push to my [GitHub](http://www.github.com/jakewengroff) and explain in detail here in my Portfolio.

Essentially, any beginning -- or advanced developer for that matter -- needs to adopt the mission of continuous self-improvement. I did not fully understand this concept when I first started to learn to code, but it is crystal clear now. I figured -- perhaps like thousands of others -- that graduation from a bootcamp or intensive program would be enough to automatically become a programmer and get a full-time job.

Not the case at all.

I remember earlier in my career, I was doing PR for a manufacturing consulting firm who was committed to showing clients the benefits of [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), the practice of continuous improvement that originated in Japan. The consulting firm would run live Kaizens right on the shop floor, seeing if improvements could be made during production.  

I was asked to participate in one of these Kaizens, and I remember traveling to a Monroe shock absorber plant in Campinas, Brazil. (Yes, the Kaizen was conducted in Portuguese, which I could hardly understand, but it was still fascinating.)

Learning to code is a personal Kaizen.

But I have decided to reward myself for my graduation from Bloc: next week, I will fly to Pittsburgh to finally meet my mentor, [Brittany Martin](http://www.twitter.com/brittjmartin), in person. Brittany has asked me to serve as a Teaching Assistant for a free [Railsbridge](https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/223) course she is leading at the Carnegie Museum of Art.

From student to TA -- not bad. But it's the least I can do to help the next group of budding developers.
